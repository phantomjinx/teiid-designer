## Login dialog
EquinoxStorageLoginDialog.secureDescription=<form> \
    <p>\
        The Eclipse framework comes with a \
        <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/juno/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Freference%2Fref-securestorage-prefs.htm">facility</a>, \
        that allows sensitive data such as passwords to be stored securely, using encryption. Access to this facility is, \
        by default, governed by a single password that is entered once on creation and thereafter when the application \
        accesses it for the first time in a running session.\
    </p>\
    <p>\
        Both the JBoss Tools Server and Teiid Designer frameworks use the secure storage facility for \
        their passwords hence it is necessary to create a password and thereafter enter it when this dialog \
        is displayed. Note. this password is the one used to access the secure storage facility and is independent \
        of the JBoss and Teiid admin and jdbc passwords. \
     </p>\
