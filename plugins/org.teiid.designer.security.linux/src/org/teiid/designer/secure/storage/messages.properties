SecureDescription=<form><p>The Eclipse framework comes with a <a href\="http\://help.eclipse.org/juno/index.jsp?topic\=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Freference%2Fref-securestorage-prefs.htm">facility</a>, that allows sensitive data such as passwords to be stored securely, using encryption. Access to this facility is, by default, governed by a single password that is entered once on creation and thereafter when the application accesses it for the first time in a running session.</p><p>A number of frameworks and applications use the secure storage facility for their passwords hence it is necessary to create a password and thereafter enter it when this dialog is displayed. Note. this password is only used to access the secure storage facility.</p></form>
